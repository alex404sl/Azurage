# Azurage :Your Go-To Tool for Azure Pentesting and CTFs

Another cloud tool for Azure pentesting and CTF challenges! I created this tool to simplify my daily Azure testing workflow and eliminate the hassle of remembering countless commands. Designed with security professionals in mind, AzuRage seamlessly enumerates, tests, and analyzes Azure environments, whether you're authenticated or unauthenticated. Its versatile features, tailored for modern cloud infrastructures, make AzuRage a potential go-to tool for Azure pentesting and exploration.

This script is a result of combining and adapting the functionality of several other tools into one cohesive framework. While it’s not perfect, it serves its purpose well—and it might just become your favorite tool too!

I'm not a professional coder, and you may find areas in this script that could be refined or written more efficiently. However, this script serves its purpose and has been a reliable companion in my Azure testing endeavors. Feel free to suggest improvements or adapt the script to suit your own needs!
